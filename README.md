# EXIF Remover

A very simple (vibe coded) Windows .NET Framework application that is visible in tray. With it running you will get an Explorer option showing `Remove EXIF data`.

As you probably can guess, then this will remove ALL EXIF data from the image file, which is handy if you want to publish the file to the internet.
